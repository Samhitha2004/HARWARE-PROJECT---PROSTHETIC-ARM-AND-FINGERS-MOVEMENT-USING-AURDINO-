# HARWARE-PROJECT---PROSTHETIC-ARM-AND-FINGERS-MOVEMENT-USING-AURDINO-

Recent technological advancements, particularly within the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT), have catalyzed the creation of novel solutions designed to improve efficiency and precision. 
This endeavor entails the introduction of a fixed robotic hand that can be operated using a mobile application, enabling users to control all five fingers, including their individual movements, for activities like remote object manipulation. 
By utilizing an Arduino Uno with in conjunction with a Bluetooth module, seamless communication between the mobile device and the robotic hand is established. 
The mobile application captures and sends user instructions via Bluetooth to the Arduino, which coordinates the servomotors propelling the robotic fingers. 
This configuration guarantees accurate and prompt manipulation, demonstrating the sophisticated integration of contemporary technology and human interaction, making it indispensable for tasks that require delicate and precise handling. 
The potential applications of this innovative system are diverse, spanning sectors such as manufacturing, healthcare, accessibility solutions, research, and education, thus underscoring its adaptability and significant impact.
